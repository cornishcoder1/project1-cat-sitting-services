            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <br>
            <p>There are many benefits to using a cat sitting service whilst you are away, as opposed to a traditional cattery. We take care of your pet at home, in their familiar environment. This prevents exposure to additional stress or potential health hazards/disease which may come with putting them into a cattery. We can also visit on a schedule that suits you and your cat, ensuring that your pet’s routine is not disturbed. We will feed your cat according to your instructions, and can also administer any medication if and when required. 

                All our staff are fully criminal record checked and insured. In addition to feeding and medicating we will also empty and clean litter trays, and spend time playing with and cuddling your cat if they so desire! For nervous cats we will give them space and try to cause as little disruption as possible during visits. For peace of mind we also have access to 24hr emergency veterinary services, should your cat fall ill whilst in our care.</p>  
            <br>    
            <p>To arrange an introductory meeting, where we will meet you and your pet in your home to discuss your requirements, please get in touch via the <a href="../project1-cat-sitting-services/contact.html" target="_blank">Contact</a> page.</p>

            <p>"Could not fault Holly & Ruby, my 9-month old kitten was safe in their hands for the three days I was away. They even picked up the post for me and watered the plants".

            <p>"I have a very timid boy who has been to a cattery a couple of times, but it just wasn't the right option for him. He would get very stressed and it would take him a while to settle once back home. Our sitter Sue treated our cat with the upmost care and compassion, and when we returned from holiday he was so much happier and more relaxed than before".

            <p>"Excellent service - my elderly cat has to receive medication three times a day for a renal condition. This was not a problem for our sitter, who visted at the requested times required to feed our cat and administer his medication. The introductory visit was much appreciated and we felt completely confident leaving our cat in the sitter's care".
