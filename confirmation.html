            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <br>
            <p>Holly & Ruby Cat Sitting Services are a network of sitters based in and around the Gwent area. The business started 10 years ago after a need was identified in the local area to offer an alternative to catteries for when pet owners are away from home. The demand for the service has increased year on year in the last decade, and we recently celebrated our 10 year anniversary with some cat themed goodies for our loyal customers!</p> 
            <br>
            <p>What matters to us is that your cat is able to stay in a familiar environment whilst you are away, with as little stress and upheaval as possible. Individual needs of animals are taken into account and we tailor care to suit their needs. We are a group of cat lovers, passionate about what we do and the care we provide. </p>
            <br>
            <p>We regularly take part in fundraising activities for local animal welfare services, including RSPCA Wales and South Wales Cat Rescue. We also collect any unwanted food and pet supplies which can be donated to local services, so please get in touch if you have food, blankets or toys that are suitable for cats or dogs. </p>
